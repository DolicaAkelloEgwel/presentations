<!-- 
- "movement-activated electronic music"
- handed out three "wands" to the audience
- each contain a smart watch running flowfal
- flowfal sends messages to Ableton - deciding which speaker to emits the most sound, controlling animations, affecting which portion of some audio is part of the overall song
- often works with dancers

<!-- My "Hmmm" and gum chewing can he heard here...
- An engineer who moved into art
- 3D printed and assembled the art himself
- robotic arm + "never-ending" IG stream, surveillence, etc
- software - python and opencv
- he told me that it didn't require an especially powerful machine to get this running, but sometimes the stream/OBS had some issues here and there
 -->

<!-- This was spun around a turnstile in the entrance, so you had no "choice" but to notice it. I also liked that it felt more embedded in the environment, rather than feeling sort of "boxed." Built with ESP32s. He spoke a little bit of his plan to build different maps. -->

<!-- Similarly had to ignore and walk past. Entagled with the environment. MicroBits were used for this, though I didn't get "how" as I figured they were more of a toy for learning how to program, so this is was quite interesting to me. -->

# Talk: A brief appeal for approachable game design

- Led by Alex Johansson
- experimental game designer
- "why focus on 100-hour games when billions have never had a meaningful gaming experience"
- novel controllers attract attention

<!-- Spoke highly of these. Said they did what he needed for plenty of installations and that he didn't have to use Arduinos until relatively recently. Problem is they are hard to find new, but he finds that schools tend to sell off the ones they no longer need on eBay at a good discount. Seemed to think they were less hassle - not that Arduinos don't have their uses. -->

# Workshop: Dreamstrument

- could be done in around 20 minutes
- use some sponges + slug repellent tape to create a "button"
- combine with MIDI and the Koala software to cause pushing the button to create a sound

<!-- Didn't really record anything from the Algorave workshop, though I did enjoy it. But I've attended similar workshops in the past. -->
