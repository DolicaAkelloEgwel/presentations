<!-- 
- "movement-activated electronic music"
- handed out three "wands" to the audience
- each contain a smart watch running flowfal
- flowfal sends messages to Ableton - deciding which speaker to emits the most sound, controlling animations, affecting which portion of some audio is part of the overall song
- often works with dancers

<!-- Spoke highly of these. Said they did what he needed for plenty of installations and that he didn't have to use Arduinos until relatively recently. Problem is they are hard to find new, but he finds that schools tend to sell off the ones they no longer need on eBay at a good discount. Seemed to think they were less hassle - not that Arduinos don't have their uses. -->
